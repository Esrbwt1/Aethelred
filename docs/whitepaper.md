# The Aethelred Protocol: A Declaration of Financial Sovereignty

## Abstract
*A single paragraph summary. The Aethelred Protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial network of autonomous AI agents designed to provide "Set-and-Forget" asset management for the digital age. It combines a user-owned Treasury Vault with an on-chain rulebook (the Codex) to empower an AI Agent to securely execute strategies while the user retains full custody and control.*

## 1. Introduction: The Burden of Modern Finance
*Describe the problems we identified: Custodial Risk, Management Burden, Human Fallibility, Information Asymmetry.*
*Explain why existing solutions (human advisors, robo-advisors, manual DeFi) are inadequate.*
*State the core mission: To create a truly autonomous financial partner that acts as a fiduciary extension of the user's will.*

## 2. The Aethelred Ecosystem: A Three-Pillar Architecture
*Describe the three core components you have built.*
*   **2.1. The Codex (Identity & Rules):** Explain the soulbound NFT, the on-chain risk parameters, and the Guardian's Whitelist. Emphasize user control.
*   **2.2. The Vault (Assets & Treasury):** Explain the non-custodial nature of the contract. The user is the `owner`, the agent is the `operator`. The user can always withdraw their funds.
*   **2.3. The Agent (Intelligence & Action):** Explain the three-agent model (Alpha, Execution, Guardian). Describe how the Alpha Agent proposes strategies based on the Codex rules and how the Guardian enforces them.

## 3. The Unforkable Moat: The `$AED` Token & The Witan
*This is the billion-dollar roadmap. Explain the flywheel.*
*   **3.1. The `$AED` Token:** It is not a currency; it is the lifeblood of the network. Explain its purpose in the Reputation Staking system (future).
*   **3.2. Collective Intelligence Mining:** Explain how users will be rewarded with `$AED` for contributing anonymized data to make the AI smarter for everyone.
*   **3.3. The Witan (Decentralized Talent Marketplace):** Explain that the protocol funds its own development. Announce that Bounties are now live on the project's GitHub.

## 4. The Calm Interface: A Philosophy of Trust
*Explain the UX design. Describe the Living Trust Score orb and the three tiers of transparency (Calm, Explainable, Emergency). The goal is not to hide complexity, but to eliminate the *need* to see it.*

## 5. Roadmap & The Path Forward
*   **Phase 0: Genesis (Complete):** Core contracts written and tested.
*   **Phase 1: Foundation (Complete):** Frontend dApp built, full interactive loop closed.
*   **Phase 2: Intelligence (Complete):** Guardian logic implemented, whitelist deployed.
*   **Phase 3: Simulation (Complete):** Alpha Agent proposal simulated on frontend.
*   **Phase 4: Treasury (Complete):** Vault deployed and funded.
*   **Phase X: The Gauntlet (Active):** We are here. Activating tokenomics, building the true off-chain agent, and growing the community.

## 6. Conclusion: An Invitation
*This is a call to action. Aethelred is more than software; it is a community-owned utility. We invite developers, security researchers, AI specialists, and visionaries to join us in building the future of finance. Visit our GitHub, claim a bounty, and help us build.*
